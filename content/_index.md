HobbyFarm is a [cloud-native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-native_computing) training tool that runs in a browser.

HobbyFarm enables developers and engineers to execute hands-on training without requiring a powerful laptop or significant cloud resources. This allows trainers to focus on delivering content and education, rather than fixing issues with outdated virtual machine setups.

## Origin

[Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com) operates training sessions called [Rodeos](https://www.rancher.com/events?event_type=rodeos), designed to teach developers and engineers about containers, Kubernetes, and Rancher technologies. These events take place at various locations, such as hotels and conferences, consisting of training presentations and hands-on labs.

These labs were conducted using virtual machines running on attendees' computers. This often caused issues due to common problems such as low-end devices, network issues, insufficient disk space, and user permissions.

[Eamon Bauman](https://github.com/ebauman) and [Chris Kim](https://github.com/Oats87) were tasked with finding a replacement for the virtual machine setup used in the training sessions. After being unsatisfied with the available options on the market, the pair decided to build a tool designed to meet the training needs of Rancher Labs.

HobbyFarm was born out of this effort, allowing developers and engineers to access cloud-native technologies without requiring a powerful computer or expensive cloud resources. With HobbyFarm, trainers can focus on delivering content and education, rather than fixing issues with outdated virtual machine setups.

Using HobbyFarm, training sessions can be conducted virtually, allowing attendees to participate from anywhere in the world.
